        <p>Course Description: </p>
        <p>   Business intelligence are the strategies and technologies companies use to collect, interpret and utilize data for decision support. This course goes beyond reports and dashboards and demonstrates how artificial intelligence can help us gain insights and recommend action. The course is comprised of five learning modules: 1.) regression and classification where data is segmented accoring to predetermined labels. 2.)  semi- and un-labelled data where items are grouped based on similarity measures. 3.) Process mining. 4.) Natural language processing, and 5.) Data ethics. Within each learning module students prepare for class and work in teams on a business problem, followed by an individual assessment. </p>

        <p>Course Description: </p>
        <p>   The course focuses on the principles of logistics and supply management and gives a broad introduction to the field. The course is divided into three topics primarily. It covers purchase operations of services and inventory management. This part is followed by looking into transportation and distribution management. Finally, the environmental impacts of logistics is studies and all the three parts put together into a view of sustainability. The course consists of lectures, exercises, game (the Beer Game) and a management simulation game to give hands on experience on logistics management.</p>

        <p>Course Description: </p>
        <p>   In this course the focus is on the methodologies of lean management where the goal is to maximize customer value. The methods used are continuous improvements (Kaizen) on the supply chain, standardized work and leveling out work load on people and machines (Heijunka). Students will learn how to use lean methodologies to maximize quality, minimize lead time while simultaneously lowering cost. Continuous flow (Just in time) can shorten the production and process time while problems in the process are identified immediately when they occur (Jidoka). Students will learn value stream mapping for both production and service process, root cause analysis along with other Lean tools such as, 5S, Kaizen Blitz, A3, visual management, Kanban and SMED. In the cours examples of companies that have gone through Lean transformation will be studied.</p>

        <p></p>
        <p> Professor : Dr. Matthias Book</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Course Description: </p>
        <p>  In this course, software engineers and computer scientists take the step from programming-in-the-small (i.e. individual developers creating compact modules that solve clearly defined problems) to programming-in-the-large (i.e. teams of developers building complex systems that satisfy vague customer requirements). To deal with the complexities of such projects, this course introduces key software engineering concepts such as agile and plan-driven software process models, requirements engineering, effort estimation, object-oriented analysis and design, software architecture and test-driven development. These concepts are immediately applied in practice as students team up to develop and integrate component-based systems using the Java programming language.</p>
